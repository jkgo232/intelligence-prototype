Additionally, the high kurtosis (22.36) indicates a distribution with heavy tails, which is often characteristic of noise or artifacts rather than a stable signal. The CNN anomaly score of 0.16 is relatively low, suggesting that the signal does not significantly deviate from expected noise patterns. Overall, these properties point towards the signal being more consistent with radio frequency interference (RFI) or noise rather than a genuine technosignature."

      "Classification: Likely RFI - Noise / artifact  \nExplanation: The candidate signal exhibits a low CNN anomaly score of 0.15, which suggests that it does not significantly deviate from expected noise patterns. Additionally, the mean normalized power is very close to zero, indicating that the signal's average power is not significantly above the noise floor. The high kurtosis value of 27.43 suggests that the signal has a very peaked distribution, which is often characteristic of noise or artifacts rather than a continuous signal typically expected from a technosignature. Furthermore, the maximum normalized power of 15.82, while seemingly high, does not provide enough context without a corresponding high mean power. The spectral entropy of 1.93 indicates a relatively low complexity, which is also more consistent with noise than with a structured signal that might indicate a technosignature. Overall, these properties suggest that the signal is more likely to be radio frequency interference (RFI) or an artifact rather than a genuine technosignature.",
