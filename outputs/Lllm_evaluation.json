Additionally, the mean normalized power is very close to zero (-0.00), suggesting that the signal does not have a consistent presence across the bandwidth, which is typical of RFI. The spectral entropy (2.03) being relatively low also supports this interpretation, as more complex signals would typically exhibit higher entropy. The CNN anomaly score (0.17) is not particularly high, but given the other characteristics, it is more likely that this is a natural or man-made interference rather than a technosignature. Therefore, this signal is classified as likely RFI - Noise / artifact."

Briefly explain your reasoning. \n\n   Respond in the following format: \n   Classification: <label> \n   Explanation: <text> Classification: Likely RFI - Noise / artifact\nExplanation: The signal has a mean normalized power of 0.00, which suggests it is not a strong candidate for a technosignature. Additionally, the kurtosis value of 377.50 is extremely high, indicating that the signal has a very heavy-tailed distribution, which is more consistent with noise or RFI than a potential technosignature. The maximum normalized power being 31.55 and the standard deviation of 1.00 also suggest that the signal has a lot of variability, which is more characteristic of noise or RFI rather than a structured signal from an advanced civilization. The spectral entropy of 1.19, while not extremely high, does not provide any additional evidence to support the signal being a technosignature. Therefore, based on these properties, the signal is more likely to be RFI or noise."

Briefly explain your reasoning. \n\n   Respond in the following format: \n   Classification: <label> \n   Explanation: <text> Classification: Likely RFI - Noise / artifact\nExplanation: The signal has a CNN anomaly score of 0.15, which is relatively low and does not indicate a high likelihood of being a technosignature. The mean normalized power is -0.00, suggesting that the signal is centered around zero, which is typical for noise or RFI. The maximum normalized power (6.23) is quite high, but this alone does not necessarily indicate a technosignature; it could be due to a strong burst of noise or RFI. The kurtosis value of 1.98 is close to the normal distribution's kurtosis (3), indicating that the signal's distribution is not significantly different from a Gaussian distribution, which is common for noise. Lastly, the spectral entropy of 3.00 is within a range that can be expected for noise or RFI, as high entropy typically indicates a more random signal. Given these characteristics, the signal is more likely to be RFI or noise rather than a technosignature.",
